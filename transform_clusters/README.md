In this project, I'm exploring clustering of 2D data points. From an initial scatter plot, it was apparent that the points could be grouped into three distinct clusters. Leveraging this insight, I implemented a KMeans model to identify these clusters and fit it to our data. 

The existing array 'points' from the prior analysis, along with an additional array 'new_points', were used. 

Let's take a closer look at the clustering I performed! I have 'new_points' as an array of points and 'labels' as an array of their cluster labels.
